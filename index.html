        <h1>World Happiness Report</h1>
        <div class="description">
          <p>
            The <b>World Happiness Report</b> is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. It reviews the state of happiness in 
            the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness. The report 
            continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators 
            to inform their policy-making decisions. In the reports, experts in fields including economics, psychology, survey analysis, 
            and national statistics, describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations, 
            and other topics.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <b>focus of this visualization</b> is exploring the World Happiness Report from Kaggle in the year <b>2019</b>, which ranks 
            <b>156 countries</b> by their happiness levels. The report primarily uses data from Gallup World Poll. The rankings of national 
            happiness are based on a Cantril ladder survey. Nationally representative samples of respondents are asked to think of a ladder, 
            with the <b>best possible life for them being a 10</b>, and the <b>worst possible life being a 0</b>. They are then asked to rate 
            their own current lives on that scale.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, let's take an <b>Overall Glance on the Happiness Score Around the World in the year 2019</b> before we dive deeper into our 
            topic!

          <h2>Overall Glance on the Happiness Score Around the World</h2>
          <p>
            This is an <b>Equal Earth map projection</b> that shows the happiness score around the world. Countries with lower happiness score
            will have a lighter colour, while countries with higher happiness score have a darker colour.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can see that most of the countries in <b>Europe and America</b> are overall happier than other countries in the world, and only 
            a few countries in Asia & Pacific has compatible happiness score with them.

            <i>Why some country’s happiness level is higher than others? What are the main factors that contribute in evaluating the happiness 
            in each country?</i> We will now look at the six other factors that are included in the report, which are: 
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Score:</b> A metric measured by asking the respondents a question: 
              "How would you rate your happiness on a scale of 0 to 10 where 10 is the happiest?"
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Economy GDP:</b> A measure of a country's economic output that accounts for its number of people, which gives us insight 
              into how well a country is doing economically
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Social Support:</b> A numeric variable which gives us insight in how much a country values friends and other people,
              including family
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Life Expectancy:</b> The average number of years that a newborn can expect to live in "full health", in other words, not 
              hampered by disabling illnesses or injuries
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Freedom:</b> A numeric variable that is based on how free an individual feels in the given country to make life choices, 
              and to perform an action selected from at least two available options, unconstrained by external parties
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Generosity:</b> The quality of being kind and generous, which gives us insight in how generous the people are in the given country
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Trust in Government:</b> A numeric variable describing how much does the people in the given country trust their government, 
              it is based on the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) that is an index published annually by Transparency International since 
              1995 which ranks countries by their perceived levels of public sector corruption, as determined by expert assessments and 
              opinion surveys
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These six factors each describes the extent to which these factors contribute in making life evaluations higher in each country 
            than they are in <b>Dystopia</b>, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the <b>world’s lowest national averages</b> 
            for each of the six factors. Let's see how are they related to each other and how they contribute to our main focus - the Happiness
            Score of each country.

          <h2>Correlation between these factors and Happiness Score</h2>
          <p>
            From the correlation plot, we can see that <b>Economy GDP, Life Expectancy, and Social Support</b> play the most significant role in 
            contributing to happiness. Meanwhile, <b>Trust in Government and Generosity</b> have the lowest impact on the happiness score. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Freedom</b> also correlates fairly with happiness score, however, we can see that it correlates fairly with every factor as 
            well, hence it does not really count as high impact to the happiness score in this case.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another interesting point is that we can see that <b>Economy, Life Expectancy and Social Support</b> correlates well within each 
            other too. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Does strong economy leads to healthier life and better social life?</i> Let's find out below!
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

    <div class="pure-g">

        <div class="description description-left">
          <p>
            From the regression line in both scatterplot, we can see that <i>the stronger the economy of a country, the better the social 
            support as well as life expectancy.</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            This result is expected as thinking logically, <i>strong economy</i> also implies people of the country has better access to 
            housing, education, health services and other items which lead to improved health, lower rates of mortality and 
            <i>higher life expectancy</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides, economy definitely is also an important foundation for a better social network, as people has extra time and resource 
            to socialize more.

      <p>
        <i>How can these factors affect the happiness score of countries around the world?</i> Let us first find out the average value of these
        factors across different regions including <i>Africa, Arab States, Asia & Pacific, Europe, Middle East, North America and South/Latin 
        America</i>.
      </p>

        <div class="description description-right">
          <h2>Average value of each factor for each region</h2>
          <p>
            This heatmap shows the average value of each factor regionally. Even though the report says that these factor values has no impact
            on the happiness score reported for each country, but they do explain why some countries rank higher than others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember that just now we had an observed from the correlation plot above that countries with higher Economy GDP, Social Support
            and Life Expectancy will theoretically have a higher happiness score? 
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>We will try to prove that our observation by observing the relationship between this heatmap with the box plot below, 
              showing the distribution of happiness score across different regions.</i>

          <h2>Distribution of Happiness Score across Different Regions</h2>
          <p>
            By observing this box plot's result and the heatmap, it seems that countries in <i>Europe and America</i> are overall happier, due to their
            stronger economy, better social support as well as life expectancy than other regions. Countries in <i>Asia & Pasific</i> and 
            <i>Middle East</i> are slightly less happier as their life expectancy was slightly lower.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Now, try to identify why countries in Africa and Arab States are the least happiest country? I'm sure you can figure it out now
              by noticing the relationship between this two plots!

    <div class="description">
      <p>
        Since we have already discussed the relationships between the different factors and happiness score, how about we try to visualize <i>the 
        relative ranking of each country by these factors</i>?
      </p>
      <h2>Relative Ranking of Countries by Happiness Score and Factors</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="pure-g">
      <div class="pure-u-1-1">
        <div id="vis7" class="vis-container"></div>

      <div class="pure-u-1-1">
        <div class="description">
          <p>
            From the parallel coordinate plot above, we can see that most of the top 25% happiest country around the world has high <b>Economy
            GDP</b>, <b>Social Support</b> as well as <b>Life Expectancy</b>. This further proves that our findings throughout this visualization 
            was quite accurate and persuasive.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, we can also observe that there are some outliers in the plot, notice that in the <b>Generosity</b> column, <i>Indonesia</i>
            and <i>Myanmar</i> has outperformed every other countries in the world, but their happiness score ranking is not even included in the
            top 50% happiest country.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Why is this the case? Is it caused by any of the three main factors that we observed contributing most to the happiness score?</i> 
            Yes! When we hover across the two points at <b>Generosity</b> column, we can see that even though Myanmar and Indonesia being 
            exceptionally generous here, but low GDP and low-ish life expectancy hinder its claim to fame in terms of happiness.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the observations that we have so far collected, we can conclude that even though these factors might not have direct impact on
            each country's happiness score, but they do explain why some of the countries rank higher than other countries, especially <b>Economy GDP</b>,
            <b>Social Support</b> and <b>Life Expectancy</b>.
