          <!-- <p>
            The <b>World Happiness Report</b> is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. It reviews the state of happiness in 
            the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness. The report 
            continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators 
            to inform their policy-making decisions. In the reports, experts in fields including economics, psychology, survey analysis, 
            and national statistics, describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations, 
            and other topics.
          </p> -->
          <p>
            The <b>focus of this visualization</b> is exploring the World Happiness Report from Kaggle in the year <b>2019</b>, which ranks 
            <b>156 countries</b> by their happiness levels. The report primarily uses data from Gallup World Poll. The rankings of national 
            happiness are based on a Cantril ladder survey. Nationally representative samples of respondents are asked to think of a ladder, 
            with the <b>best possible life for them being a 10</b>, and the <b>worst possible life being a 0</b>. They are then asked to rate 
            their own current lives on that scale.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, let's take an <b>Overall Glance on the Happiness Score Around the World in the year 2019</b> before we dive deeper into our 
            topic!

            <li>
              <b>Score:</b> A metric of Happiness Score (on scale of 0 - 10)
            <li>
              <b>Economy GDP:</b> A measure of how well a country is doing economically
            </li>

              <b>Social Support:</b> How much a country values friends, family and other people
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Life Expectancy:</b> The average number of years that a newborn can expect to live in "full health"

            <li>
              <b>Generosity:</b> How generous the people are in the given country

              <b>Trust in Government:</b> How much does the people in the given country trust their government

            for each of the six factors. Let's see how are they related to each other and how they contribute to our main focus - the Happiness

          <h2>Correlation between these factors and Happiness Score</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Economy GDP, Life Expectancy, and Social Support</b> play the most significant role in 
            contributing to happiness. <b>Trust in Government and Generosity</b> have the lowest impact on the happiness score. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Freedom</b> correlates fairly with happiness score, but it does so with other factors as 
            well, hence it does not really count as high impact to the happiness score in this case.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another interesting point is, <b>Economy, Life Expectancy and Social Support</b> correlates well within each 
            other too.

            This <b>heatmap</b> shows why some countries rank higher than others.

          <p>
            From the observation we have above from correlation plot, countries with higher Economy GDP, Social Support
            and Life Expectancy will theoretically have a higher happiness score.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>We will prove that by observing the relationship between this heatmap with the box plot below,

          <h2>Distribution of Happiness Score across Different Regions</h2>
          <p>
            It seems that countries in <i>Europe and America</i> are overall happier, due to their
            stronger economy, better social support as well as life expectancy than other regions. Countries in <i>Asia & Pasific</i> and 
            <i>Middle East</i> are slightly less happier as their life expectancy was slightly lower.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Now, try to identify why countries in Africa and Arab States are the least happiest country? I'm sure you can figure it out now

          <p>
            We can see that most of the <b>top 25% happiest country</b> around the world has high <b>Economy GDP</b>, <b>Social Support</b> 
            as well as <b>Life Expectancy</b>. This further proves that our findings throughout this visualization 
            was quite accurate and persuasive.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, we can also observe that there are some outliers in the plot, notice that in the <b>Generosity</b> column, <i>Indonesia</i>
            and <i>Myanmar</i> has outperformed every other countries in the world, but their happiness score ranking is not even included in the
            top 50% happiest country.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we hover across the two points at <b>Generosity</b> column, we can see that even though Myanmar and Indonesia being 
            exceptionally generous here, but <b>low GDP</b> and <b>low-ish life expectancy</b> hinder its claim to fame in terms of happiness.
          </p>
          <p>
            To conclude, even though these factors might not have direct impact on
            each country's happiness score, but they do explain why some of the countries rank higher than other countries, especially <b>Economy GDP</b>,
            <b>Social Support</b> and <b>Life Expectancy</b>.
